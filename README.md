# 20_Digital-_Stream_Python
Digital Stream. My educational program from Al Sweigart's"'Big Book of Small Python Projects"

This program mimics the “digital stream” visualization from the science fiction movie "The Matrix". Random beads of binary “rain” stream up from the bottom of the screen, creating a cool, hacker-like visualization.
